Project goal: Evaluate employee retention and attrition rates by various factors based on the healthcare sector database in the US.

Retention rate by gender

Retention rate by department

Retention rate by Years with the company and current manager

Marital Status, Overtime relation to retention rate

Age relation to retention 

Distance From Home relation to retention


If we continue analyzing all the data (married or divorced / comparatively high hourly rate or no, etc.) then we can answer the following question: what is the leading cause of attrition? Are they positively/negatively correlated?
